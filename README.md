Description:

This is a personal media compression app that can take certain images files, video files, and audio files. It can copy these files and make a new file with a different size and quality. The app will take files from your computer and place the new file in the working directory. 

***
FFmpeg command line tool must be downloaded on the computer to utilise the video and audio compression, as it is not a python package.
